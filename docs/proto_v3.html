        <h1>Protocol Version 3</h1>

        <p>
            If the client and the server agree on protocol version 3 after <a
                href="index.html#proto-negotiation">negotiation</a>, the client starts communicating using that
            protocol. First, the client selects the method and requests it from the server. Then, the server accepts the
            request and continues the communication.
        </p>

        <h2 id="method-selection">Selecting the Method</h2>
        Selecting the method in protocol version 3 is identical to the procedure of <a
            href="proto_v2.html#method-selection">selecting the method in protocol version 2</a>.<br>
        <a href="#method-codes">Method codes</a> in protocol version 3 are almost the same as the method codes in
        version 2, except for some differences in the <a href="#get-files">Get Files</a> and <a href="#send-files">Send
            Files</a> methods and some newly added methods. They are described in the <a
            href="#supported-methods">Supported Methods</a> section.

        <h2 id="method-codes">Method Codes</h2>
        <p>Note that some method codes in Version 3 are almost the same as the <a
                href="proto_v2.html#method-codes">method codes in Version 2</a>, with some newly added method codes.</p>

        <h2 id="method-status-codes">Method Status Codes</h2>
        <p>Method status codes in protocol version 3 are identical to <a href="proto_v2.html#method-status-codes">method
                status codes of version 2</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="supported-methods">Supported Methods</h2>
        <p>
            Most of the supported methods are similar to those of <a href="proto_v2.html#supported-methods">Version
                2</a> except for some differences in Get Files, Send Files, and the two newly added methods.<br>
            Encoding of lengths, text, file names, file contents, and images and the maximum allowed text lengths, file
            name lengths, file sizes, and image sizes are identical to those of <a
                href="proto_v1.html#encoding-notes">Version 1 and 2</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="get-text">Get Text</h3>
        <p>
            This method is identical to the <a href="proto_v1.html#get-text">Get Text method of Version 1 and 2</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="send-text">Send Text</h3>
        <p>
            This method is identical to the <a href="proto_v1.html#send-text">Send Text method of Version 1 and 2</a>.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-files">Get Files</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the copied files and directories from the server to the client. The only
            difference between this method and the <a href="proto_v2.html#get-files">Get Files method of Version 2</a>
            is that Version 2 does not support sending empty leaf directories, whereas this method of Version 3 supports
            sending empty leaf directories in addition to files and non-empty directories.</p>
        <p>
            Since this method supports sending empty leaf directories, their file size is transferred as -1, and the
            file content is considered empty. All other parameters (name length and name) are sent similarly to regular
            files. The directory name may optionally end with the path separator '/'.</p>
        <p>
            Similarly to the <a href="proto_v2.html#get-files">Get Files method of Version 2</a>, the server starts by
            sending the number of files and then sends each file sequentially. Once all the files are transmitted, the
            communication ends, and the connection can be closed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="send-files">Send Files</h3>
        <p>
            This method is similar to the <a href="#get-files">Get Files method</a> except that the client sends the
            file count and each file/directory sequentially to the server (i.e., the direction of communication after
            selecting the method is reversed). All the size limits and file path constraints are the same as the <a
                href="#get-files">Get Files method</a> described above.
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-image">Get Image/Screenshot</h3>
        <p>
            This method is identical to the <a href="proto_v1.html#get-image">Get Image method of Version 1 and 2</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-copied-image-only">Get Copied Image Only</h3>
        <p>
            This method is similar to the <a href="#get-image">Get Image/Screenshot</a> method, except that if there is
            no image copied to the clipboard, the server will not send a screenshot as the image. Instead, the server
            will respond with the status NO_DATA to the method request and terminate the connection.
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-screenshot-only">Get Screenshot Only</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get a screenshot from the server to the client. Even if the server has an image
            copied to the clipboard, it will send only a screenshot of the server device. The screenshot is encoded as a
            PNG image. Once the client requests this method code from the server, the server acknowledges the client
            with the status OK. Then, the client sends the display number from the server, and the server acknowledges
            the client with the status OK if the display number is valid. Then, the server will send the screenshot. The
            communication after protocol version negotiation happens as follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the client sends the method request code.</li>
            <li>The server responds with the status OK.</li>
            <li>Next, the client sends the display number, encoded as a numeric value, to get the screenshot. The
                display number can be from 1 to 65536 inclusive. Also, the display number can be sent as -1 to let the
                server use its default display. Display number 0 is reserved, and the behavior is undefined.
            </li>
            <li>The server responds with the status OK if the screenshot is taken and proceeds to the next step.
                Otherwise, it will send the status NO_DATA and terminate the connection.</li>
            <li>Then, the size of the screenshot image in bytes is sent. The image can be at most 1 GiB in size. It is
                encoded as a numeric value, as specified in <a href="proto_v1.html#encoding-notes">data encoding
                    notes</a>.</li>
            <li>Finally, the screenshot is sent as a stream of bytes, as specified in <a
                    href="proto_v1.html#encoding-notes">data encoding notes</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        Once the image is transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. Note that the server
        may not always honor the display number sent by the client. Also note that if the display number is invalid or
        the server fails to get the screenshot, the server may respond with the status NO_DATA instead of OK and
        terminate the communication immediately.
        <h3 id="info">Info</h3>
        <p>
            This method is similar to the <a href="proto_v2.html#info">Info method of Version 2</a> with the exception
            that this method in version 3 can send some additional name-value pairs describing the server information
            after the server name. The length field sent first denotes the total length of the response text. The first
            line of the response text contains the server's name, "clip_share", as in previous versions. Other
            name-value pairs appear in separate lines, where one line contains a single name-value pair. Lines are
            separated with LF (i.e. '\n').</p>
        <p>
            A name-value pair is separated by a colon (':'). The name and value fields can contain alpha-numeric
            characters, period ('.'), hyphen ('-'), and underscore ('_'). In addition to that, the value field may
            contain any other ASCII characters from '\x20' to '\x7e' inclusive, except colon (':'), which is the
            name-value separator. The maximum length of the name field is limited to 64 characters, and the maximum
            length of the value is limited to 256 characters.
