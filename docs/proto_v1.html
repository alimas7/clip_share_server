        <h1>Protocol Version 1</h1>

        <p>
            If the client and the server agree on protocol version 1 after <a
                href="index.html#proto-negotiation">negotiation</a>, the client starts communicating using that
            protocol. First, the client selects the method and requests it from the server. Then the server accepts the
            request and continues the communication.
        </p>

        <h2 id="method-selection">Selecting the Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The client starts by sending the <a href="#method-codes">method code</a> in a single byte (ex: if the
                method code is 1, the client sends \x01). The method code can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 125. Refer to the <a
                    href="#supported-methods">Supported Methods</a> section for more information about the methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upon receiving the method request, the server responds with a single byte denoting the <a
                    href="#method-status-codes">method status code</a> for that request. If the method request is
                accepted, the server and the client will continue communication. Refer to the <a
                    href="#supported-methods">Supported Methods</a> section for more information about the structure of
                the remaining part of the communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the method request is not accepted or there is no more communication to happen, the client and the
                server will close the connection.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When the server receives a method request from the client, it will respond to the client with one of the
            following status codes. The status code will be sent to the client as a single byte. For example, if the
            status code is 1, the server sends the byte \x01.

                        (possibly because there is no text or files copied into the clipboard of the server device).
                        Therefore, the communication ends at this point, and the connection can be closed now.

        <h2 id="supported-methods">Supported Methods</h2>
        <p>The following methods are supported in this protocol version.</p>
        <p id="encoding-notes">
            <b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>All numeric values (ex: lengths and number of files) are sent/received as 64-bit signed integers in
                big-endian format.</li>
            <li>All the lengths of strings and file sizes are measured in bytes, and they are sent/received as numeric
                values as specified above.</li>
            <li>All the texts sent/received are UTF-8 encoded and do not contain a terminating null byte or any other
                prefixes or suffixes. The length of a text is calculated after encoding in this way.</li>
            <li>All the files sent/received are considered binary files. Therefore, the Unix/Windows style line endings
                or other platform-specific things in the file content are not changed. Also, the file content is
                considered a sequence of bytes, which is not modified (compressed or encoded) during transmission. The
                names of the files are considered as text and thus sent/received as specified above.</li>
            <li>Optional: Strings having line breaks should prefer LF ("\n") over CRLF ("\r\n") as the line separator.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-text">Get Text</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the copied text from the server to the client. Once the client requests this
            method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send
            the length of the copied text followed by the copied text to the client. Once the copied text is
            transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. The client may copy the received text
            to the clipboard of the client device.
        <ul>
            <li>The length is the number of bytes in the text sent after this. It should be less than 4 MiB in size. The
                length is encoded and sent, as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>The copied text is the text that is copied to the clipboard of the server device. It is encoded as
                specified above in the notes.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="send-text">Send Text</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to send the copied text from the client to the server. Once the client requests this
            method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the client will send
            the length of the copied text followed by the copied text to the server. Once the copied text is
            transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. The server may copy the received text
            to the clipboard of the server device.
        <ul>
            <li>The length is the number of bytes in the text sent after this. It should be less than 4 MiB in size. The
                length is encoded and sent, as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>The copied text is the text that is copied to the clipboard of the client device. It is encoded as
                specified above in the notes.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-files">Get Files</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the copied files from the server to the client. This method only supports sending
            regular files (i.e., directories, links, or other types are not supported). Once the client requests this
            method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send
            the number of files encoded as a numeric value as specified above in the notes. After sending the number of
            files, each file is sent sequentially, as follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the length of the file name is sent. A file name can have at most 1024 bytes after encoding. It
                is encoded as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>Then, the file name is sent. It is a text encoded as specified above in the notes. The file name cannot
                contain the characters '/' (forward-slash) or '\' (back-slash).</li>
            <li>Next, the size of the file is sent. File size can be at most 64 GiB. It is encoded
                as a numeric value, as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>Then, the file content is sent as a stream of bytes, as specified above in the notes.</li>
        </ul>
        Once all the files are transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="send-file">Send File</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to send a file from the client to the server. This method only supports sending a single
            regular file at a time (i.e., directories, links, or other types are not supported). Once the client
            requests this method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the
            client will send the file to the server as follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the length of the file name is sent. A file name can have at most 1024 bytes after encoding. It
                is encoded as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>Then, the file name is sent. It is a text encoded as specified above in the notes. The file name cannot
                contain the characters '/' (forward-slash) or '\' (back-slash).</li>
            <li>Next, the size of the file is sent. File size can be at most 64 GiB. It is encoded
                as a numeric value, as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>Then, the file content is sent as a stream of bytes, as specified above in the notes.</li>
        </ul>
        Once the file is transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-image">Get Image/Screenshot</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get a copied image or a screenshot from the server to the client. If the server
            device has an image copied to the clipboard, it will be sent. Otherwise, a screenshot of the server device
            will be sent as an image. The image gets encoded as a PNG image. Once the client requests this method code
            from the server, and if the server can get the image, the server acknowledges the client with the status OK.
            Then, the server will send the image as follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the size of the image in bytes is sent. The image can be at most 1 GiB in size. It is encoded as
                a numeric value, as specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>Then, the image is sent as a stream of bytes, as specified above in the notes.</li>
        </ul>
        Once the image is transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. Note that there is no
        file name for the image. The client should create a file name if it needs to save this image as a file. If the
        server fails to get the image, it will send the status NO_DATA for the client's request instead of the status
        OK and terminate the connection without sending any further data.
        </p>
        <h3 id="info">Info</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the name of the server. Once the client requests this method code from the
            server, and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send the length of the
            name, followed by the server's name, "clip_share", to the client. Once the name is transmitted, the
            communication ends, and the connection can be closed.
        <ul>
            <li>The length is the number of bytes in the name sent after this. It is encoded and sent, as
                specified above in the notes.</li>
            <li>The server's name is encoded as a text, as specified above in the notes.</li>
